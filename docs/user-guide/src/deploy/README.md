# Deployment
CeresDB is a distributed timeseries database and multiple CeresDB instances can be deployed as a cluster for high availability and scalability.

For now, CeresDB only supports one deployment form that features static, rule-based routing. In the future (maybe in 1.0.0 release version), a powerful cluster deployment will be supported and then the CeresDB cluster will support dynamic expansion and contraction.
